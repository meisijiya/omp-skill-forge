"""Gate: the recorded upstream pin must still describe the pool it pins.

    python tools/check_upstream_pin.py

The pin is written by tools/sync_upstream.py right after it refreshes pool/:
manifest/upstream.json holds the upstream commit plus a digest of the pool
content, and manifest/groups.json keeps a hand written copy of the same
commit.  Four things can drift, and each of them is a defect:

  1. manifest/upstream.json is malformed -- the commit is not a 40 character
     hex id, or the repo is missing.  Everything downstream (the CI pin, the
     `git checkout` of the upstream clone) trusts that value.
  2. manifest/groups.json carries a different commit than the pin file.  The
     two are written by different code paths, so the copy can rot unnoticed.
  3. pool/ was changed by hand (or by a partial sync) without the pin being
     updated.  Then the pin describes a pool that is no longer in the
     repository.
  4. NOTICE.md quotes an upstream commit that is not the pinned one.  The
     notice is shipped with the plugin and read by humans, so a stale sha
     there claims a provenance the repository does not have.

The pool digest is recomputed with compute_pool_digest() imported from
tools/sync_upstream.py -- the writer and the checker share one implementation
on purpose: a second copy of the algorithm could disagree on path ordering or
separator bytes and then report a healthy pool as broken.

The tool is local, offline and repeatable: no network, no environment
variables, no clock, no randomness.  The same tree always produces the same
output and the same exit code.

Exit codes
  0  the pin is consistent (all four checks pass)
  1  at least one check failed; every failure is printed
  2  the pin files could not be read (missing file, invalid JSON, unreadable
     pool tree)
