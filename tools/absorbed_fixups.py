"""Declarative rewrites that turn an absorbed skill into an omp-safe one.

`tools/sync_absorbed.py` fetches a third-party skill, runs the rules below,
and stores the rewritten copy under `absorbed/<source>/`.  The rules exist
because those skills were written for other harnesses:

  * slash triggers (`Use for /correct.`) name commands this fork never ships
    -- ADR-0008 keeps commands out of the runtime tree, so INV-14 would
    report every one of them.
  * `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.codex/` and `Claude` wording is what INV-02,
    INV-03 and INV-15 forbid.
  * `disable-model-invocation:` and `paths:` are host-specific frontmatter
    keys; omp ignores them and they only add noise.
  * sibling-skill links (`../principle-foo/SKILL.md`, "skills in this pack")
    point at files this fork does not ship.

A rule is `(find, replace, note)` where `find` is a regular expression that
MUST match exactly once.  A miss is drift: upstream reworded the sentence,
the rewrite no longer applies, and `sync_absorbed.py` fails instead of
shipping a half-adapted skill.  Order matters: later rules see the output of
earlier ones.

`SOURCE_RULES` holds rules that apply to every markdown file of a source and
may match many times (`(find, replace, note, expected)`).  They exist for
whole-tree conventions -- a shared knowledge base referenced from a dozen
skills, a marketplace-only frontmatter key -- where one rule per occurrence
would be noise.  The expected total is what `{prefix}`-rewritten source trees
must reproduce: a different count means upstream reworded the text and the
rule has to be revisited, exactly like the exactly-once rules above.
